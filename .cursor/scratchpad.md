# Work Display Implementation

## Background and Motivation

The user has created a new document type "work" in Sanity CMS and wants to implement the display functionality for works. The requirements are:

1. Display all available work documents on the `/work` route
2. Each work should be clickable and navigate to `/work/[id]` for individual work details
3. Follow the same pattern as the existing blog implementation

**NEW REQUEST**: Implement responsive video handling for the landing page where each video will have two versions - one for mobile view and one for desktop view.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Need to create the work listing page (`/work`) similar to blog listing
- Need to create individual work detail page (`/work/[id]`) similar to blog detail
- Work schema includes: title, slug, image, and content (markdown)
- Should follow the existing design patterns and styling from blog implementation

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Work Listing Page
- **Success Criteria**: `/work` page displays all work documents in a grid layout
- **Implementation**: 
  - Create work listing page similar to blog listing
  - Fetch all work documents from Sanity
  - Display work items in a responsive grid
  - Each work should link to its individual page

### Task 2: Create Individual Work Detail Page
- **Success Criteria**: `/work/[id]` page displays individual work details
- **Implementation**:
  - Create work detail page similar to blog detail
  - Fetch individual work by slug
  - Display work image, title, and content
  - Handle markdown content rendering

### Task 3: Add Static Generation Support
- **Success Criteria**: Work pages are statically generated for better performance
- **Implementation**:
  - Add `generateStaticParams` function for work detail pages
  - Ensure proper static generation for all work pages

## Project Status Board

- [x] Task 1: Create Work Listing Page
- [x] Task 2: Create Individual Work Detail Page  
- [x] Task 3: Add Static Generation Support
- [x] **NEW**: Implement Responsive Video Handling for Landing Page

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Task 1 Completed**: Created work listing page at `/work` that displays all work documents in a responsive grid layout. Each work item shows the image, title, and a preview of the content. Clicking on any work navigates to the individual work detail page.

**Task 2 Completed**: Created individual work detail page at `/work/[id]` that displays the full work details including image, title, creation date, and rendered markdown content.

**Task 3 Completed**: Added `generateStaticParams` function to the work detail page for static generation support, ensuring better performance.

**Video Support Added**: Updated both work listing and detail pages to support video display. Videos are prioritized over images - if a video is available, it will be displayed; otherwise, the image will be shown. Videos in the listing page are muted and looped, while videos in the detail page have controls and autoplay.

**Responsive Video Implementation Completed**: Successfully implemented responsive video handling for the landing page. Each video now has mobile and desktop versions that automatically switch based on screen size. Features include:
- Automatic detection of mobile vs desktop viewport
- Dynamic video source switching using React hooks
- Fallback to desktop version if mobile version doesn't exist
- Visual indicator showing which video version is currently displayed
- Responsive breakpoint at 768px (standard mobile breakpoint)
- Console logging for debugging purposes

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Implementation Complete**: All tasks have been successfully completed. The work functionality is now fully implemented and ready for testing.

**Ready for User Testing**: The implementation follows the same patterns as the existing blog functionality and should work seamlessly with the existing Sanity setup.

## Lessons

- **Schema Consistency**: The work schema follows the same pattern as the blog schema, making implementation straightforward
- **Static Generation**: Added `generateStaticParams` function to ensure optimal performance for work detail pages
- **Markdown Rendering**: Used `markdown-it` library (already installed) for rendering work content, following the same pattern as blog posts
- **Design Consistency**: Maintained the same styling and layout patterns as the existing blog implementation for consistency
- **Error Handling**: Implemented proper error handling with `notFound()` for non-existent work items
- **Video Support**: Added conditional video/image display logic - videos are prioritized over images for better user experience
- **Video Optimization**: Used appropriate video attributes (muted, loop, playsInline) for listing page and controls/autoplay for detail page

## New Feature Request: Responsive Video Implementation

### Background
The user wants to implement responsive video handling for the landing page where each video will have two versions:
- One optimized for mobile view
- One optimized for desktop view

### Current Implementation Analysis
- Landing page currently uses a single video file for each section
- Videos are displayed with `object-cover` class for responsive sizing
- No conditional logic for different video sources based on screen size

### Implementation Options
1. **CSS Media Queries**: Use CSS to show/hide different video elements
2. **React Hooks**: Use `useEffect` and `window.innerWidth` to conditionally render videos
3. **Next.js Image Component Pattern**: Follow similar responsive image patterns
4. **HTML5 Picture Element**: Use HTML5 `<picture>` element with `<source>` tags

### Recommended Approach
Use React hooks with `useEffect` and `window.innerWidth` for the most reliable cross-browser solution, following the pattern used in other parts of the application.
