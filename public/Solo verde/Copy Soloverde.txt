Soloverde Farm

Owing to our strong interest in agriculture, we approached Soloverde Farms, a youth-led farm in Ibadan. During our conversation with its founder, he was candid about the challenges of running a farm in Nigeria today. Following that conversation, it became clear that our role was to translate that spirit into a visual identity that embodied the resilience required for growth.

We developed a new identity that pays homage to the farm's cassava roots while also introducing new possibilities. Soloverde's rebrand positions the company for innovation, sustainability, and untapped agricultural potential.
