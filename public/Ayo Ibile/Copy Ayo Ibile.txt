Ayo Ibile

What began as a collection of images and the idea for a photography exhibition on the streets evolved into a cultural initiative celebrating the richness of Lagos carnival traditions.
The first Ayo Ibile was a photography show in Ketu with a production design that encouraged a friendly, neighborhood-focused atmosphere.

We created a visual identity based on earthy greens to represent growth and connection to the land. A minimalist approach allowed the vibrancy of the carnival imagery to shine, while Tac One, a Nigerian typeface inspired by Festac '77, grounded the project in local cultural history.

In collaboration with the host community, Big Valley, we ensured that the project belonged to the people as well as the artists. By bringing art to the streets, we liberated the images from the confines of galleries, making the exhibition a communal experience for all.
