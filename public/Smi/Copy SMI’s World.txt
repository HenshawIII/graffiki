Most SMEs lack a clear visual identity, limiting their ability to scale and connect meaningfully with customers. However, SMI World broke that jinx when they contacted us.

We chose a subdued, earthy colour palette inspired by natural elements, soft textures, and African beauty traditions. Then, we paired it with delicate, flowing type that exuded ease. Collectively, these aesthetic choices resulted in an identity that reflected SMI World's goal of providing accessible hair care.
