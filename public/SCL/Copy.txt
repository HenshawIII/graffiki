SCL Stretches Contracting Limited

Stretches Contracting Limited (SCL), a custom-build construction company, approached us about creating a brand identity that reflected the most important aspect of their craft: attention to detail. We responded with a logo that embodies deliberate thought.

SCL's new identity is based on the idea of a "stretched house", a visual metaphor for pushing the limits of design, innovation, and quality craftsmanship.

With a brand system that struck a balance between precision and refinement, our goal was to present SCL as an exemplar of accessible luxury. Our collaboration with SCL serves as a reminder of our commitment to listening carefully to each client's story and transforming their ideas into visually compelling content.
